Common error codes you may see in R and what they mean:
1. Variable Type: Doing math on a non-numeric varibles will often give you an error, most with dates, text strings, and so on.
2. Syntax. Make sure and check for missing commas, missing parentheses, also check for proper upper and lower case when items are case sensitive.
